What classes I might need:
BST and their implementation
I would likely need multiple BSTs, one for each type of search that we're gonna be using
probably nodes for the BST (then they contain seminars)
BINTree but i can hold off on this
this one will be for the last kind of search (will be 2d)

Command Processor/controller from project 1
Command Processor will parse calls and invoke correct command 
Controller will then process that command (should pass the tree that we're operating on, for find and delete)
	for insert, controller should call insert for each of our 5 trees
	this means it should also create a seminar, and 5 nodes each corresponding to a tree
	
for search:
	im going to try using the same search function in controller for all trees
	for searches through a range, or that return multiple nodes, how do i print them all?
	
	
for insert:
	how do i want to handle duplicate inserts?
	linked list through BSTNode in case i wanna reuse this BSTree code
		(some self balancing trees dont like other solutions)

		
for print:
